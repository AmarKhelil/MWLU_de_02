This project aims to present alternative mobility concepts in Ludwigshafen and surrounding areas. 

Most politicians have affirmed that mega projects heavily biased toward car mobility are essential to secure the city's future. This is especially true for the so-called 'Helmut-Kohl-Allee'. Because of the tremendous financial volume involved, the city will lack the resources to start the necessary ecological and social bifurcation that the constitutional court in Germany has entailed on politicians and government because the preservation of climate and environment for the future generation is a fundamental right.

This homepage will try to explore alternative designs and ideas, reinventing the concept of mobility toward more efficiency, sustainability, and quality of life. We intend to cooperate with all citizens, creators, designers, and experts, who are willing to expose their ideas and publish them.
